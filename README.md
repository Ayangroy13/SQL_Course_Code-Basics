### Course Work
### Day 1:
• SELECT, FROM and WHERE are the basic SQL functions means all columns. Using '' after the SELECT query will select all columns of a database With the help of the USE function, you can indicate the query to use a particular database, especially when there are multiple databases

• The COUNT function will provide the numerical count of rows

• The DISTINCT function will help you see the unique values present in a given column '%' is a wild card search

• Use the LIKE function and '%' to filter the rows based on a text value

• SELECT, FROM and WHERE are the basic SQL functions means all columns. Using '' after the SELECT query will select all columns of a database

• With the help of the USE function, you can indicate the query to use a particular database, especially when there are multiple databases

• The COUNT function will provide the numerical count of rows

• The DISTINCT function will help you see the unique values present in a given column

• '%' is a wild card search

• Use the LIKE function and '%' to filter the rows based on a text value

•<,<, >, 2 are the basic numerical operators used in SQL.

• You can also use AND, OR, BETWEEN, IN to perform numerical queries.

• You can sort the table by using the 'ORDER BY' clause.

• By default, it sorts the data in ascending order but you can specify the sort order.

• LIMIT clause can be used to fetch the top 'N' or bottom 'N' amount of records. 'N' can be any numerical value.

• OFFSET clause will help you to skip a certain number of rows in your final result

• Knowing Summary Analytics in SQL will enable you to perform AD HOC Analysis which is an important business use case

• MAX, MIN, and AVG are the common summary analytics functions of SQL

• You can define a custom column header name by using the 'as' clause

• GROUP BY clause will help you to create a summary of metrics such as average, count, etc. for selected column(s)

• The order of query execution in - SQL is FROM →WHERE → GROUP BY →HAVING → ORDER BY

• GROUP BY and HAVING clauses are often used together

• The Column you use in HAVING should be present in the SELECT clause whereas WHERE can use columns that are not present in the select clause as well

• You can derive new columns from the existing columns in a table

• As a data analyst, Revenue and Profit are the most common metrics that you will calculate in any industry

• Currency conversion and unit conversion are important business use cases of SQL

• IF function is often used in SQL queries

• When you have more than two conditions, you need to use CASE and END function instead of IF Function

### Day 2:
• Companies use multiple tables to store data

• To save space by avoiding repetition

• Organize data better

• Make updates easily

• In SQL you will be able to map multiple tables using the JOIN clause

• JOIN and ON clauses used together will enable you to merge two tables

• JOIN, ON & AND clause will enable you to merge two tables based on multiple columns

• There is an export button in the SQL editor through which you can download results as.csv file

• You can assign an abbreviated letter next to the table name to shorten the query length

• There are multiple kinds of JOIN in SQL: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL and CROSS JOIN

• By default, SQL performs an INNER JOIN

• LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOINS are also called OUTER JOIN

• UNION clause will enable you to perform FULL JOIN

• Concatenation means combining two text strings

• CONCAT clause in SQL will help you combine two text strings

• Knowing Excel will help in your understanding of SQL

• CROSS JOIN is useful when you do not have any common column between two tables

• You would need to merge the tables often to create meaningful insights for business

• Spend time to understand JOIN thoroughly as you will use it a lot in SQL

• Finding TOP N/BOTTOM N is another common business use case that you can achieve by ORDER BY

• Whenever you get a requirement from a business stakeholder break the challenge down into simpler pieces before writing a query.

• Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) will help you to understand the relationship between the tables.

• Group_Concat Function will enable you to combine text from multiple rows to one row
